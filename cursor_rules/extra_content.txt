💬 User Experience
Step 1: User tags the agent

@fetch-pizza I want pizza!
Step 2: Agent requests a story

🍕 Welcome to Pizza Paradise! I'm your friendly pizza fairy! ✨

Before I can grant you a magical pizza coupon, I need to hear your 
most epic pizza story! Tell me about:
• Your craziest pizza adventure
• Your dream pizza combination  
• A time pizza saved your day
• Or any pizza-related tale!

The more creative and fun your story, the better your coupon might be! 🎭
Step 3: User shares story

Once I was stuck in a snowstorm and the only place open was this tiny 
pizza shop. The owner made me a custom pizza with ingredients from his 
personal stash - best pizza of my life!
Step 4: Agent evaluates and rewards

😊 Great story! You've earned a solid coupon!
